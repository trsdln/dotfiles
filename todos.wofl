* try alacritty
* rething session management
  * put session file into repo root (branch relation out of the box)
    \ I usually don't need to open session from another branch
    \ advantage: sharing session between multiple work stations
  * default open/save session command/mapping: ss/so
  * custom tagged open/close session mapping (not sure I need this though - never used it in current setup)
